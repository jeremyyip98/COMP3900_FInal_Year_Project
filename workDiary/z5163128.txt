Week 1:
Brainstorming project ideas. We came up with the idea of a pet e-commerce site that focuses on the welfare of pets.
We also decided to combine a chatbot into the e-commerce site so that it could become one of our novel feature. 

Created the Jira project and helped creating the user stories in Jira. 

Week 2:
Did an analysis of Gumtree as an e-commerce platform. Found some flaws and issues that could be improved on our platform. 

For the proposal, helped created the acceptance criteria for chatbot, sales tracking, delivery, 
product moderation, wishlist and review.
