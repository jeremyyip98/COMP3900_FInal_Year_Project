Week 1:
Brainstorming project ideas. We came up with the idea of a pet e-commerce site that focuses on the welfare of pets.
We also decided to combine a chatbot into the e-commerce site so that it could become one of our novel feature. 

Created the Jira project and helped creating the user stories in Jira. 

Week 2:
Did an analysis of Gumtree as an e-commerce platform. Found some flaws and issues that could be improved on our platform. 

For the proposal, helped created the acceptance criteria for chatbot, sales tracking, delivery, 
product moderation, wishlist and review. 

Week 3: 
Added to and cleaned up the user story table. Came up for acceptance criterias for chatbot, sales tracking, delivery, product moderation, wishlist, review

Week 4:
Working on the search function. Simple product search by name works.

Week 5:
Presented Sprint 1 and we did our retrospective A in class after the presentation

Week 7:
Explored different APIs to integrate a chat system into our project. However, there was little resources available. Found pinax-messages and the functionalities work. 
A little compromise from the supposed chat system because it is more of a messaging feature. However, html files provided broke. Moving the deadline for the chat system to sprint 3. 

Week 8:
Presenting Sprint 2

Week 9: 
Researched any open source project related to messaging and found pinax-messages. Spent all of this week and last week trying to integrate the code with our project.
Since it was made in an older version of Django, many features were deprecated and needed modifying. 

Week 10:
Presented Final Demo and worked on the Project Report
