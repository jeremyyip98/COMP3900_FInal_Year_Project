Work Diary
week 1
We had group meeting on Sunday and discussed about the project topics. 
We finished most of the user stories by that day.

week 2
We had group meeting on Saturday and we already copied all the user stories to jira.
I started to create wireframes to Balsamiq and created links between pages.

week 3 
I added more pages for buyer and seller to our Balsamiq cloud.
Add screenshots of the Balsamiq pages to our google doc and add links and descriptions for 
each feature.
Completed the proposal together in our Friday meeting.
